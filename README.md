# photoAlbum

A simple app that grabs albums from a random API and displays thumbnails along with pictures and titles that can be edited on the state level. This was done for my assessment to get a new job! :)

This photoAlbum app was built with React Native Expo. Debugging and development were done by referring to the web instead of on iOS simulator and Android.

To run:

Open terminal,

Make sure you have npm or yarn installed.
If you haven't installed React Native expo CLI on your machine, enter `yarn global add expo-cli`

First of all, you need to `yarn` to install all the dependencies.
Then, `yarn web` or `expo start`(press w for web once loaded) to run the app.

That's it!

P.S, to test the responsiveness of the UI, be sure to refresh the page after changing to different devices.
Thanks!

(Development started on the 8th of June 2022 6pm, ended on 10th of June 2022 12pm.)
